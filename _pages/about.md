I am currently a Research Scientist at [VAST AI Research (VAIR)](https://x.com/VastAIResearch?s=20), building [Tripo](https://tripo3d.ai).

My research interest is to enable machines to understand, reconstruct, and generate 2D/3D visual content from real-world data, with a focus on 3D mesh generation and vector font generation. Within these areas, I am especially interested on tasks on native 3D meshes, e.g. quad meshing, native mesh generation, native mesh texturing, UV unwrapping, etc. 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Graphics & Geometric Computing Lab at Tsinghua University (THU) in 2025, supervised by Prof. [Song-Hai Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AWtV-EQAAAAJ). Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technolog at Tsinghua University (THU) in 2020, co-supervised by Prof. [Shi-Min Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LDb4tb0AAAAJ) and Prof. [Song-Hai Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AWtV-EQAAAAJ).

Beyond research, I am also deeply interested in Origami (paper folding).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
